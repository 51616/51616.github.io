- I have completed bachelor's degree in computer engineering at [Chulalongkorn University](https://chula.ac.th/en/). My undergraduate projects are shown in my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ybpn0q8JlNufmmYgdQR-1Pa0JltDMxOV_dlWW_VYRQw/export?format=pdf).
- My research interests focus mainly on _generalization_ in deep reinforcement learning, cooperative and competitive multi-agent learning and meta-learning.
