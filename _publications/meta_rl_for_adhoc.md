abstract = {Ad hoc teamwork problem describes situations where an agent has to cooperate with
previously unseen agents to achieve a common goal. For an agent to be successful in
these scenarios, it has to have cooperative skills. One could implement cooperative
skills into an agent by using domain knowledge (e.g., goals, roles, and protocols)
to design the agent's behaviours. However, in complex domains, domain knowledge might
not be available. Therefore, it is interesting to explore how to directly learn cooperative
skills from data. In this work, we apply meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) formulation
in the context of ad hoc teamwork problem. Our experiments show that such a method
could produce cooperative agents in two cooperative environments with different cooperative
circumstances.},
